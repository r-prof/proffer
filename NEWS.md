# proffer 0.1.1

* Address a CRAN check error for R-devel on Windows: lengthen the time of a test to avoid empty protocol buffers.
* Build site with GitHub Actions and use flatly theme (#26, @krlmlr).
* Ping port until `pprof` is initialized (#28).
* Improve console messages of host and port.
* Forward error message if `pprof` process quits early.

# proffer 0.1.0

* `pprof()` passes `...` to `record_pprof()` (#12, @krlmlr).
* In the `DESCRIPTION`, unquote function names and add parentheses afterwards. (CRAN comments for next submission.)
* Motivate profilers more in the README.
* Increase font size in logo.
* Search systems for `pprof` if the `pprof_path` env var is not set (#14, @krlmlr).
* Use `PROFFER_PPROF_BIN` env var instead of `pprof_path` (#11, @krlmlr). `pprof_path` is still back-compatibly supported.
* Introduce new environment variables `PROFFER_GO_BIN` and `PROFFER_GRAPHVIZ_BIN` to allow the user to set the paths to the respective binaries (#11, @krlmlr).
* Add a new `pprof_sitrep()` function to give a situation report of the `pprof` installation, its dependencies, and their environment variables (#17, @krlmlr).
* Add new function `test_pprof()`.

# proffer 0.0.2

* Respond to CRAN feedback on version 0.0.1. Software and API names in the `DESCRIPTION` now appear in single quotes, the grammatical errors are gone, and new links reference the methodological background and context of `proffer` (<https://github.com/google/pprof>, <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>, and <https://github.com/r-prof/profile>).
* Use `processx` instead of `callr` (#5, @gaborcsardi).
* Add Graphviz installation instructions.
* Add pprof and Graphviz as system requirements.

# proffer 0.0.1

* First version.

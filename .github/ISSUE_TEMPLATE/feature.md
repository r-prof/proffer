## Prework

- [ ] Read and abide by `proffer`'s [code of conduct](https://github.com/r-prof/proffer/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- [ ] Search for duplicates among the [existing issues](https://github.com/r-prof/proffer/issues), both open and closed.

## Proposal

Describe the new feature clearly and concisely. If applicable, write a minimal example in R code or pseudo-code to show input, usage, and desired output.

To help us read any code you include (optional) please try to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The `style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.

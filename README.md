The `proffer` package profiles R code to find bottlenecks. Visit
<https://r-prof.github.io/proffer> for documentation.
<https://r-prof.github.io/proffer/reference/index.html> has a complete
list of available functions in the package.

## Why use a profiler?

This data processing code is slow.

``` r
system.time({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#>   user  system elapsed 
#> 82.060  28.440 110.582 
```

Why exactly does it take so long? Is it because `for` loops are slow as
a general rule? Let’s find out empirically.

``` r
library(proffer)
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:64610
```

When we navigate to <http://localhost:64610> and look at the flame
graph, we see `[<-.data.frame()` (i.e. `x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1`) is taking
most of the runtime.

</a>

</center>

So we refactor the code to avoid data frame row assignment. Much faster,
even with a `for` loop\!

``` r
system.time({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- rnorm(n)
  y <- rnorm(n)
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i] <- x[i] + 1
    y[i] <- y[i] + 1
  }
  x <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.037   0.000   0.038
```

Moral of the story: before you optimize, throw away your assumptions and
run your code through a profiler. That way, you can spend your time
optimizing where it counts\!

## Managing the pprof server

Sometimes, your `pprof` server may not work right away. If that happens,
take a look at the error logs.

``` r
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:50195

px # How is my background process doing?
#> PROCESS 'R', finished.
px$is_alive()
# [1] FALSE

px$read_error() # Why did it quit soon?
#> [1] "sh: /user/local/bin/pprof: No such file or directory\nWarning message:\nIn system2(Sys.getenv(\"PROFFER_PPROF_PATH\"), args) : error in running command\n"

# Can my system find pprof?
test_pprof()
#> Error: cannot find pprof executable. See the setup instructions at https://r-prof.github.io/proffer.
assert_pprof()
#> Error: cannot find pprof executable. See the setup instructions at https://r-prof.github.io/proffer.
pprof_path()
#> ""

# Maybe my system cannot find the pprof executable.
# Let me find out where I actually installed pprof.
system("which", "pprof")
#> "/home/landau/alternative/path/pprof"

# I can put a line in my .Rprofile or .Renviron file
# to automatically tell new sessions where pprof lives.
Sys.setenv(PROFFER_PPROF_PATH = "/home/landau/alternative/path/pprof")

# Now, pprof should work.
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:64610

px
#> PROCESS 'R', running, pid 12361.
px$is_alive()
# [1] TRUE

# Now a web browser should be able to open http://localhost:64610.
```

It is best to take down the `pprof` server when you are done with it.

``` r
px$kill()
```

`px` is the handle of a [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr)
background process. To learn more about how to manage the process, have
a look at the [`callr`](https://callr.r-lib.org/) documentation,
particularly the function
[`r_bg()`](https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html).

## Installation

The latest release of `proffer` is available on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

``` r
install.packages("proffer")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-prof/proffer")
```

To use functions `pprof()` and `serve_pprof()`,
[`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof) needs to be installed. This
requires a working Go installation and Graphviz. If you have trouble,
please do not hesitate to [open an
issue](https://github.com/r-prof/proffer/issues) and ask for help. The
[`profvis`](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/) package is an excellent
alternative with fewer dependencies.

As you follow the installation instructions below, you can run
`test_pprof()`, `assert_pprof()`, or `pprof_path()` at any time to see
if `proffer` can find and use `pprof`. If these functions succeed early,
you are already done.

1.  Install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org) and ensure the Graphviz
    executables appear in your `PATH` environment variable ([directions
    here](https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GVIZ/pages/131924165/Graphviz+installation)).
2.  [Install the Go programming
    language](https://golang.org/doc/install).
3.  Ensure your system can find the Go binaries. Open your command line
    interface of choice (e.g. Terminal or Command Prompt) and type `go
    version`. If you get an error, you may need to set the `PATH`
    environment variable as described [here for
    Linux](https://www.callicoder.com/golang-installation-setup-gopath-workspace/#linux)
    and [here for
    Windows](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/12/easy-go-programming-setup-for-windows/)
4.  Follow [these
    instructions](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) to
    set the `GOPATH` environment variables on your system. Type `go env
    GOPATH` in in a new terminal session verify that you set it
    correctly.
5.  Enter `go get -u github.com/google/pprof` in your terminal to
    install `pprof`
6.  Find the path to the `pprof` executable. It is usually in the `bin`
    subdirectory of `GOPATH`, e.g. `/home/landau/go/bin/pprof`.
7.  Add a line to your `.Renviron` file to set the `PROFFER_PPROF_PATH`
    environment variable, e.g.
    `PROFFER_PPROF_PATH=/home/landau/go/bin/pprof`. This variable tells
    `proffer` how to find `pprof`.
8.  Open a new R session check that pprof installed correctly.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
Sys.getenv("PROFFER_PPROF_PATH")
#> /home/landau/go/bin/pprof
file.exists(Sys.getenv("PROFFER_PPROF_PATH"))
#> TRUE
system2(Sys.getenv("PROFFER_PPROF_PATH")) # Shows the pprof help menu on Unix systems.
shell(Sys.getenv("PROFFER_PPROF_PATH")) # Analogous for Windows.
```

## Configuration

The following environment variables let you manually configure the non-R
dependencies of `proffer`.

  - `PROFFER_PPROF_PATH`: path to the installed
    [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof) executable.
  - `PROFFER_GO_BIN_PATH`: path to the installed [Go
    language](https://golang.org/) binary.
  - `PROFFER_GRAPHVIZ_PATH`: path to the installed
    [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) executable.

Profilers identify bottlenecks, but the do not offer solutions. It helps

## Similar work

### profvis

The [`profvis`](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis) is much easier to
install than `proffer` and equally easy to invoke.

``` r
library(profvis)
profvis({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
```

However, `profvis`-generated flame graphs can be [difficult to
read](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/115) and [slow to
respond to mouse
clicks](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/104).

`proffer` uses [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof) to create
friendlier, faster visualizations.
